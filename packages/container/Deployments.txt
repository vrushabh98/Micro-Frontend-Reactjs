###### Requirements around Deployments ##########
    1. We want to deploy each microfrontend independently (indluding the container).
    2. Location of child app remoteEntry.js files must be known at build time.
    3. Many front-end deployment solutions assume you are deploying a single project - we need something that can handle multiple different ones.
    4. Probably need a CI/CD pipeline of some sort.
    5. At present, the remoteEntry.js file name is fixed! Need to think about caching issues.
